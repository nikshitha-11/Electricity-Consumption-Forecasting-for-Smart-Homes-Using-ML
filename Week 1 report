Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Report
📌 1. Introduction

The Individual Household Electric Power Consumption dataset contains minute-level measurements of electrical power usage from a single household.
Before performing data analysis and machine learning tasks, the dataset must be cleaned and preprocessed to ensure reliable results.

This report describes the steps followed to clean and preprocess the dataset.

📂 2. Dataset Overview

Dataset Name: Household Power Consumption Dataset

Records: ~2,075,259 rows

Features: 9

Time Period: December 2006 – November 2010

Dataset Columns
Column	Description
Date	Date of observation (dd/mm/yyyy)
Time	Time of observation
Global_active_power	Household global minute-averaged active power (kW)
Global_reactive_power	Minute-averaged reactive power (kW)
Voltage	Minute-averaged voltage (V)
Global_intensity	Average current intensity (ampere)
Sub_metering_1	Energy sub-metering No. 1 (Wh)
Sub_metering_2	Energy sub-metering No. 2 (Wh)
Sub_metering_3	Energy sub-metering No. 3 (Wh)
🧹 3. Data Cleaning
3.1 Handling Missing Values

The dataset contained missing data marked as "?".
These values were converted to NaN using:

na_values="?"


After conversion, rows with missing values were removed:

df.dropna(inplace=True)


✅ Ensured that all remaining data points are valid numeric values.

🔄 4. Data Type Conversion

The dataset originally stored numeric values as strings.
All columns except datetime were converted to numeric format:

df[col] = pd.to_numeric(df[col], errors='coerce')


✅ Ensured all computations and modeling can be done correctly.

⏳ 5. Datetime Preprocessing

The dataset had separate Date and Time columns.
They were combined into a single timestamp:

df['Datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'] + " " + df['Time'], format="%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S")


Then original columns were dropped and datetime set as index:

df.drop(columns=['Date', 'Time'], inplace=True)
df.set_index('Datetime', inplace=True)
df.sort_index(inplace=True)


✅ The dataset is now time-series formatted, ready for forecasting.

📊 6. Final Dataset Characteristics
