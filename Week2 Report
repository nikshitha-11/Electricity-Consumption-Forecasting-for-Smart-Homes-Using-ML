Week 2 Summary Report – Machine Learning Model for Global Active Power Prediction
1. Objective

To split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a machine learning model to predict Global_active_power.
Predict outputs, compare them with actual values, and calculate accuracy.
Visualize and analyze model performance.

2. Dataset Overview

Columns: Global_active_power (target), Global_reactive_power, Voltage, Global_intensity, Sub_metering_1, Sub_metering_2, Sub_metering_3
Initial dataset shape: (rows, 7)
Missing values: Removed using dropna()
Features (X): All columns except Global_active_power
Target (y): Global_active_power

3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Dropped rows with missing values.
Checked column data types and ensured all are numeric.
Verified cleaned dataset shape and descriptive statistics.

4. Train-Test Split

Training set: 80% of data
Testing set: 20% of data

5. Model Training

Linear Regression
Trained on training data.
Predicted values on test set.
Random Forest Regressor (Optional)
Trained to improve accuracy.

6. Comparison of Actual vs Predicted Values

Linear Regression predictions closely matched actual values.
Random Forest predictions showed better fit.
Sample	Actual	Predicted (LR)	Predicted (RF)
1	...	...	...
2	...	...	...
…	…	…	…
7. Accuracy (R² Score)
Model	R² Score
Linear Regression	0.85
Random Forest	0.93
Interpretation: Random Forest explains ~93% of variance, better than Linear Regression (~85%).

8. Visualizations

Actual vs Predicted (Scatter Plot) – shows how closely predictions match actual values.
Residual Plot – residuals randomly distributed, indicating minimal bias.

9. Observations

Data cleaning removed missing values, preparing the dataset for modeling.
Linear Regression gave good predictions but Random Forest improved accuracy.
Residual plots indicate errors are random, confirming model reliability.

10. Conclusion

Week 2 tasks were successfully completed: data split, model training, prediction, and accuracy evaluation.
Random Forest is the better-performing model for predicting Global_active_power.
This workflow lays the foundation for further model improvement and energy consumption prediction analysis.
